              <h3>SKYNET</h3>
              <p>
                Our team decided to go with the name Skynet. The reason behind
                this is because our project is to create an AI-machine learning
                virtual assistant. We believe that AI will be the technology
                that will dominate the industry in the near future. As
                developers, we wish to be the pioneers of this field. In pop
                culture, there is this popular movie where a tech company
                created an AI that is so smart and advance that it can calculate
                then travel time to terminate anything that is a threat to the
                future. That movie was Terminator and the name of the company is
                Skynet. We thought to ourselves, what better name can we choose
                for this group other than Skynet.()

                      “I was born and raised in Hanoi. Ever since I was a child,
                      I have been remarked to be extremely curious. I often hide
                      adults from taking apart electronics in the house to find
                      out how they work inside and then putting them back
                      together. When I was a little older, I was exposed to a
                      computer and was immediately captivated by what it could
                      do especially with video games where I could interact with
                      non-player characters. One day, I was watching a robot
                      cartoon called Wall-E, once again my passion for
                      technology was aroused, at that time I wished when I grew
                      up, I could create a robot with a conscious and perception
                      as a human being. After 2 years of studying, I realized
                      that was not really the major I wanted to pursue. I
                      suddenly realized that what I want to create is not a
                      robot, but the brain of that robot. In order to achieve
                      that goal of mine, I decided to study information
                      technology to learn how humans can teach computers and how
                      computers interact with humans.”

                      “I was born and grown up in Ho Chi Minh City. During my
                      time in Secondary Highschool, I had a chance to experience
                      Pascal Programming. From there, I realize that information
                      technology is a powerful tool that can solve many math
                      problems with just some simple lines of code. Ever since I
                      know about gaming and web surfing, I have always wondered
                      how they are programmed. I wanted to program games,
                      application as well as websites for myself so I decided to
                      study IT. Personally, I have taken a Front-end course
                      therefore I have some experience in Java Script and CSS to
                      create basic websites base on my knowledge of designing
                      and programming. However, my back-end development skill is
                      still not sharpened so I have a lot to learn.
                      Additionally, I am taking a French course which I think
                      might be useful for my future career. Beside from that,
                      playing guitar for me is an excellent way to relief the
                      stress after a long period of studying and cooking for the
                      family is another passion of mine. Moreover, in order to
                      achieve my goal of being a professional game/web
                      developer, I have a habit of reading books about life and
                      developing skills as a way of self-development”.

                      “Similar to our front-end developer, am also born and
                      raised in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. However, I come from
                      a mixed culture family because my ancestors were from
                      China. Being born in a strict Chinese family, I have
                      developed a sense of responsibility and hark-working
                      attitude toward my goals. But I love playing games, it
                      just every boys passion. Back in the days, my cousin, who
                      has been a specialist in IT for several years now, usually
                      came to my house and showed me some hacking tricks for the
                      game, he even helped me cracked the wifi passwords of
                      local neighbors, which was very cool. I then thought to
                      myself, IT was so astonishing and have so many potentials
                      in the future, so I developed the passion ever since. I
                      still have long way to go since I just finished learning
                      about the basic concepts in IT, but I am eager to learn
                      more. During school times, I am focused and determined but
                      in my free time, I enjoy doing various sport activities as
                      way to keep my head cool and my body strong. I also enjoy
                      reading new research papers to update my knowledge on
                      things happening around the world and what new technology
                      that should be minded in order to keep up the trend.”

                      “I was born in a small village in Hai Duong, Vietnam.
                      After graduation in high school, I went to Ho Chi Minh
                      City for studying in the university. In IT field, I am
                      really interested in programming which is about building
                      games.. When i was in Highschool, I used to changes values
                      in games data so that the money would increase, which
                      werer really fun experiences for me so I developed an
                      interest for IT since. I have had basic knowledge about
                      Python and had tried creating my own games but they are
                      still under development and I still have a long way to go.
                      In my free time, I often do part-time jobs, social
                      activities and enjoy my time at the Taekwondo club as well
                      as playing the guitar to relief school stresses.. For
                      example, I took part in an outside bonding with my club
                      which is Taekwondo. One time, we even went climbing with
                      the whole club. It was a memorable day for me because we
                      try so hard and finally we managed to get to the top. The
                      feeling was very proud and relief because I had finally
                      achieve the goal of that day. One day, I will reach the
                      peak of my dream and become a great game developer.”

                          As the Briggs-Myers test suggested, Quy is an
                          introvert, this trait of personality suggest that he
                          would feel more comfortable with his inner thoughts
                          and ideas, rather than what is happening around then
                          externally. He works like any others sharing his
                          trait, try finding the answer alone and do detail
                          research before comes up with the final answer.
                          However, when it comes to making decision, he is
                          unlike most other introverts, he is straight forward
                          and logical. One think should be minded is that he
                          sometimes may have self - doubts so it is best that he
                          has people around to encourage him with his ideas.

                          According to Quy’s big five tests, he has quite an
                          imagination, it is described that people with high
                          score of openness is creative and intellectual, they
                          love playing around with new ideas and would think in
                          an abstract way. Which is a strong point for his
                          career He is also very responsible and lead a
                          self-discipline lifestyle as his score of
                          consciousness suggests. However, his score of
                          Neuroticism is rather high at 50% which show that he
                          can sometimes experiences mood-swing and sadness.
                          Thus, as suggested above, he should have company
                          around to cheer him up and encourage him.

                          Last but not least, as an Auditory learner, the best
                          way for him to learn and attain new knowledge is by
                          listening and hearing. This type of learner would
                          normally store information by the way it sounds and
                          would have easier time understanding voice

                          he it is best that we regularly have meeting so that

                          empathetic towards people. Maybe due to her being
                          emotional which overwhelm her reasoning, she often
                          avoids words that affect people's emotions. Being too
                          soft will make it easier for her to sympathize with
                          the mistakes that people make, which will

          Each of the members is a different type of learner. However, that is what diversify the team and make us more colorful. Finally, our big-five results show the most important aspects when working in groups is that we all have the ability to co-operate with others to do greater things. <br>
          Overall, the team combination will work out. Each of us have different strength and weaknesses. However, one’s strength will combine with others weakness to neutralize and create a stable team. More important is that we all share common hobbies so we can get to know each other later, sharing the same dreams of being developers so we are determined and will try our best to achieve that goal together.
