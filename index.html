                      “I was born and raised in Hanoi. Ever since I was a child,
                      I have been remarked to be extremely curious. I often hide
                      adults from taking apart electronics in the house to find
                      out how they work inside and then putting them back
                      together. When I was a little older, I was exposed to a
                      computer and was immediately captivated by what it could
                      do especially with video games where I could interact with
                      non-player characters. One day, I was watching a robot
                      cartoon called Wall-E, once again my passion for
                      technology was aroused, at that time I wished when I grew
                      up, I could create a robot with a conscious and perception
                      as a human being. After 2 years of studying, I realized
                      that was not really the major I wanted to pursue. I
                      suddenly realized that what I want to create is not a
                      robot, but the brain of that robot. In order to achieve
                      that goal of mine, I decided to study information
                      technology to learn how humans can teach computers and how
                      computers interact with humans.”

                      “I was born and grown up in Ho Chi Minh City. During my
                      time in Secondary Highschool, I had a chance to experience
                      Pascal Programming. From there, I realize that information
                      technology is a powerful tool that can solve many math
                      problems with just some simple lines of code. Ever since I
                      know about gaming and web surfing, I have always wondered
                      how they are programmed. I wanted to program games,
                      application as well as websites for myself so I decided to
                      study IT. Personally, I have taken a Front-end course
                      therefore I have some experience in Java Script and CSS to
                      create basic websites base on my knowledge of designing
                      and programming. However, my back-end development skill is
                      still unrefined so I have a lot to learn. Additionally, I
                      am taking a French course which I think might be useful
                      for my future career. Beside from that, playing guitar for
                      me is an excellent way to relief the stress after a long
                      period of studying and cooking for the family is another
                      passion of mine. Moreover, in order to achieve my goal of
                      being a professional game/web developer, I have a habit of
                      reading books about life and developing skills as a way of
                      self-development.”

                      “Similar to our front-end developer, am also born and
                      raised in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. However, I come from
                      a mixed culture family because my ancestors were from
                      China. Being born in a strict Chinese family, I have
                      developed a sense of responsibility and hark-working
                      attitude toward my goals. But I love playing games, it
                      just every boys passion. Back in the days, my cousin, who
                      has been a specialist in IT for several years now, usually
                      came to my house and showed me some hacking tricks for the
                      game, he even helped me cracked the wifi passwords of
                      local neighbors, which was very cool. I then thought to
                      myself, IT was so astonishing and have so many potentials
                      in the future, so I developed the passion ever since. I
                      still have long way to go since I just finished learning
                      about the basic concepts in IT, but I am eager to learn
                      more. During school times, I am focused and determined but
                      in my free time, I enjoy doing various sport activities as
                      way to keep my head cool and my body strong. I also enjoy
                      reading new research papers to update my knowledge on
                      things happening around the world and what new technology
                      that should be minded to pick up the trend.”

                      City for studying in the university. In IT field, I am
                      really interested in programming which is about building
                      games.. When i was in Highschool, I used to changes values
                      in games data so that the money would increase, which
                      werer really fun experiences for me so I developed an
                      interest for IT since. I have had basic knowledge about
                      Python and had tried creating my own games but they are
                      still under development and I still have a long way to go.
                      In my free time, I often do part-time jobs, social
                      activities and enjoy my time at the Taekwondo club as well
                      as playing the guitar to relief school stresses.. For
                      example, I took part in an outside bonding with my club
                      which is Taekwondo. One time, we even went climbing with
                      the whole club. It was a memorable day for me because we
                      try so hard and finally we managed to get to the top. The
                      feeling was very proud and relief because I had finally
                      achieve the goal of that day. One day, I will reach the
                      peak of my dream and become a great game developer.”
