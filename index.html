              <h3>SKYNET</h3>
              <p>
                Our team decided to go with the name Skynet. The reason behind
                this is because our project is to create an AI-machine learning
                virtual assistant. We believe that AI will be the technology
                that will dominate the industry in the near future. As
                developers, we wish to be the pioneers of this field. In pop
                culture, there is this popular movie where a tech company
                created an AI that is so smart and advance that it can calculate
                then travel time to terminate anything that is a threat to the
                future. That movie was Terminator and the name of the company is
                Skynet. We thought to ourselves, what better name can we choose
                for this group other than Skynet.

            <p>GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. <br><br>

              GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line. <br><br>
              
              GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – like writing books. <br><br>
              
              Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects. <br><br>
              
              As a company, GitHub makes money by selling hosted private code repositories, as well as other business-focused plans that make it easier for organizations to manage team members and security. We utilize Github extensively at Kinsta to manage and develop internal projects.</p>

                      “I was born and raised in Hanoi. Ever since I was a child,
                      I have been remarked to be extremely curious. I often hide
                      adults from taking apart electronics in the house to find
                      out how they work inside and then putting them back
                      together. When I was a little older, I was exposed to a
                      computer and was immediately captivated by what it could
                      do especially with video games where I could interact with
                      non-player characters. One day, I was watching a robot
                      cartoon called Wall-E, once again my passion for
                      technology was aroused, at that time I wished when I grew
                      up, I could create a robot with a conscious and perception
                      as a human being. After 2 years of studying, I realized
                      that was not really the major I wanted to pursue. I
                      suddenly realized that what I want to create is not a
                      robot, but the brain of that robot. In order to achieve
                      that goal of mine, I decided to study information
                      technology to learn how humans can teach computers and how
                      computers interact with humans.”

                      “I was born and grown up in Ho Chi Minh City. During my
                      time in Secondary Highschool, I had a chance to experience
                      Pascal Programming. From there, I realize that information
                      technology is a powerful tool that can solve many math
                      problems with just some simple lines of code. Ever since I
                      know about gaming and web surfing, I have always wondered
                      how they are programmed. I wanted to program games,
                      application as well as websites for myself so I decided to
                      study IT. Personally, I have taken a Front-end course
                      therefore I have some experience in Java Script and CSS to
                      create basic websites base on my knowledge of designing
                      and programming. However, my back-end development skill is
                      still not sharpened so I have a lot to learn.
                      Additionally, I am taking a French course which I think
                      might be useful for my future career. Beside from that,
                      playing guitar for me is an excellent way to relief the
                      stress after a long period of studying and cooking for the
                      family is another passion of mine. Moreover, in order to
                      achieve my goal of being a professional game/web
                      developer, I have a habit of reading books about life and
                      developing skills as a way of self-development”.

                      “Similar to our front-end developer, am also born and
                      raised in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. However, I come from
                      a mixed culture family because my ancestors were from
                      China. Being born in a strict Chinese family, I have
                      developed a sense of responsibility and hark-working
                      attitude toward my goals. But I love playing games, it
                      just every boys passion. Back in the days, my cousin, who
                      has been a specialist in IT for several years now, usually
                      came to my house and showed me some hacking tricks for the
                      game, he even helped me cracked the wifi passwords of
                      local neighbors, which was very cool. I then thought to
                      myself, IT was so astonishing and have so many potentials
                      in the future, so I developed the passion ever since. I
                      still have long way to go since I just finished learning
                      about the basic concepts in IT, but I am eager to learn
                      more. During school times, I am focused and determined but
                      in my free time, I enjoy doing various sport activities as
                      way to keep my head cool and my body strong. I also enjoy
                      reading new research papers to update my knowledge on
                      things happening around the world and what new technology
                      that should be minded in order to keep up the trend.”

                      “I was born in a small village in Hai Duong, Vietnam.
                      After graduation in high school, I went to Ho Chi Minh
                      City for studying in the university. In IT field, I am
                      really interested in programming which is about building
                      games.. When i was in Highschool, I used to changes values
                      in games data so that the money would increase, which
                      werer really fun experiences for me so I developed an
                      interest for IT since. I have had basic knowledge about
                      Python and had tried creating my own games but they are
                      still under development and I still have a long way to go.
                      In my free time, I often do part-time jobs, social
                      activities and enjoy my time at the Taekwondo club as well
                      as playing the guitar to relief school stresses.. For
                      example, I took part in an outside bonding with my club
                      which is Taekwondo. One time, we even went climbing with
                      the whole club. It was a memorable day for me because we
                      try so hard and finally we managed to get to the top. The
                      feeling was very proud and relief because I had finally
                      achieve the goal of that day. One day, I will reach the
                      peak of my dream and become a great game developer.”

                          As the Briggs-Myers test suggested, Quy is an
                          introvert, this trait of personality suggest that he
                          would feel more comfortable with his inner thoughts
                          and ideas, rather than what is happening around then
                          externally. He works like any others sharing his
                          trait, try finding the answer alone and do detail
                          research before comes up with the final answer.
                          However, when it comes to making decision, he is
                          unlike most other introverts, he is straight forward
                          and logical. One think should be minded is that he
                          sometimes may have self - doubts so it is best that he
                          has people around to encourage him with his ideas.

                        <p>
                          According to Quy’s big five tests, he has quite an
                          imagination, it is described that people with high
                          score of openness is creative and intellectual, they
                          love playing around with new ideas and would think in
                          an abstract way. Which is a strong point for his
                          career He is also very responsible and lead a
                          self-discipline lifestyle as his score of
                          consciousness suggests. However, his score of
                          Neuroticism is rather high at 50% which show that he
                          can sometimes experiences mood-swing and sadness.
                          Thus, as suggested above, he should have company
                          around to cheer him up and encourage him.

                          Last but not least, as an Auditory learner, the best
                          way for him to learn and attain new knowledge is by

                          It can be said that she is an extrovert and always
                          willing and dedicated to helping others. In addition,
                          she admitted that she does not have a big ego. In
                          fact, she always listens and absorbs everyone's
                          suggestions. That can be seen as her strong point when
                          working in groups. Because when you work in a team,
                          listening and absorbing feedback is an important thing
                          for you to correct your mistakes and improve yourself.
                          In addition, she is willing to help people when they
                          need it and she feel happy to help them.

                          However, her downside is being too selfless and
                          empathetic towards people. Maybe due to her being
                          emotional which overwhelm her reasoning, she often
                          avoids words that affect people's emotions. Being too
                          soft will make it easier for her to sympathize with
                          the mistakes that people make, which will
                          inadvertently make everyone in the team irresponsible
                          and affect the overall outcome of the team. Therefore,
                          she needs to control her emotions and work more
                          rationally.

          Overall, the team combination will work out. Each of us have different strength and weaknesses. However, one’s strength will combine with others weakness to neutralize and create a stable team. More important is that we all share common hobbies so we can get to know each other later, sharing the same dreams of being developers so we are determined and will try our best to achieve that goal together.

                      <h1>Cybersecurity and Privacy</h1>
                      <p>In the time of technology development, networking is increasingly common and becomes important to people in daily life. They share themselves on social media like Facebook. In companies,  they use the internet for controlling the system and storing data. Due to this, they easily become targets of cyber attacks. Hence, there is a need of the security for networking to prevent violations of the access from cyber threats.</p>
                      <img src="./image/security-1.png" alt="">
                      
                      <p>Cyber security is about doing solutions and measures for protecting the computer system and data against threats on the network, such as malwares, unauthorized access, and ransomware. Also, the security is stronger and more robust, the data will be protected safer and will not be fell into the hand of cyber threats. Hackers usually mainly phish money, inject malware into the system, and lose control of the system to cater to their needs or purposes. As the same with cyber security, privacy is a form of securing information that requests permission from users to access or login their data. This helps individual documents or personal details possibly avoid being snooped. Depending on the user’s permission, their information will be shared, used and collected based on setting the level of privacy from them. It is easy to see on social media. People possibly set up who can see their posts, for example public, friends, or only user, to keep their information safe on the network. They also are explained about the use of personal information transparently and simply in any cases before providing.</p>
                      <img src="./image/security-2.png" alt="">
                      <p>Over the years, cyber security and privacy have increasingly developed and advanced more technology and knowledge. For knowledge, people have known and understood more about measures for networking safely. They use long passwords and make two factor authentications for the access. Moreover, Users are more self-aware about using and protecting individual data. They have had the limitation of sharing information. For technical security, there are many appearances of tools and software, which support protecting users against cyber threats. People use scan tools for confirming identity. There may be QR code, face ID, or fingerprint. Moreover, the governments have enacted laws and policies about using and providing data on the network. In many countries, people can delete personal information by sending requests, choose out of providing personal information to the third parties, and access data in the third parties if there is permission. Users also receive notifications about what type of personal data that companies have collected, and reasons that they do the use. In the past, cyber security and privacy were not too good for data protection. Some large companies in the world were the victim of many cyber-attacks and heavily suffered financial losses because connective devices and routers did not really activate efficiently, though they had spent a lot of money on the improvement of the system. Currently, people have had precautions for themselves and security software is more and more widely used on devices. Based on developing technology in these days, security software may be a good choice for improving in the future. It may add auto checking if there is unknown software running on the device or use to check the staff go to the companies by scanning their faces through the camera.</p>
                      <img src="./image/security-3.png" alt="">
                      <img src="./image/security-5.jpg" alt="">
                      <p>With the development of cyber security, businesses will be affected the most in any sector. They can have personal information of customers when customers reveal or write on their database, and they use the infrastructure, IP or Mac addresses to associate with an individual. Therefore, when data is used for the security system, people will probably be identified. In enterprise eco-systems, the user’s server systems tend to be managed in an organized manner. However, they just can show customer’s data in the limitation and are not able to reveal it to third parties without permission, because revealing it can affect customers badly. There will probably be the approach to them or their locations with targets like attacking, scamming and disturbing. For example, customer’s data in banks often has attention from sellers for marketing. The seller will probably text messages or call customers to ask them about buying products or services every day. This will make people uncomfortable because of the seller’s importunity. At the same time, revealing the information without permission leads to the company losing the trust from customers. In addition, this development will replace the guard who checks in the staff go to the company and reduce the number of guardian working. Many companies apply to use cameras for tracking, so the guarder just need to work when there has problems about the system.</p>
                      <img src="./image/secuirty-6.jpg" alt="">
                      <p>In the time of technology 4.0, internet becomes very common to people in many fields, especially the society. Almost all of people have used social media for interacting and contacting each other. Because of this, I have been using several applications like Facebook. When I used for over one year, I worried about losing data, which is pictures and some documents in my account and the application suggests to me measures to protect the account by adding my personal information for confirming identity and avoiding unknown access. Also, I often change my password to keep the account more secure. I usually use numbers and texts for the password to make difficult to remember, but it often brings the connotation related to my favorites or hobbies. Furthermore, my personal information is not posted publicly. I keep it individually on social media, or only my friends can see it. This affects my parents a lot for networking. They worry about the way that my siblings will share a lot of individual information without thinking, because we will be the target for scammers. Therefore, my parents sometimes talk with us about keeping and sharing information in reasonable way.</p>

                    <h1>Small Computing Devices</h1>
                    <p>It can be seen clearly that Information Technology (IT) seems to appear in the whole world and impact a lot on our lives. IT was simply known as a field that use technology to store and process data. Areas of IT typically Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Computing, etc., are growing and being more popular day by day. And with a demand that is convenient and portable for users, small computing devices becoming an indispensable part of IT. So, what is computing? It can be explained that computing uses algorithmic procedures to manage and process data including designing, developing, and building hardware and software systems various kinds of information. Small computing devices are closely related to the portability of hardware, data, and software in computer applications. In this report, we will show some types of small computing devices, including what is familiar to us such as laptops, smartphones, watches, etc., or some that may not be universally known, these are single-board microcontrollers and single-board computers.</p>
                    <p>In general, small computing devices can be called a boom evolution of the IT world. The primitive devices which were simple, limited capacity as well as cumbersome, and unportable were replaced by small computers however sophisticated which are more powerful with an elegant look and mobile. It can be said that microcomputers handled many tough questions of the old computer systems and change the way the world work. In spite of the small computing lowered the production cost and size of the system, the productivity and effects of these devices are not reduced, but significantly improved. It is not only access and evaluates data quickly and accurately but also helps individuals deal with their work problems easier. Moreover, its handiness is also an advantage that attracts users and makes it become popular and well-received. These days, small computing devices are applied in many fields such as healthcare, education, economy, etc., and it can be seen clearly that it helps everything simpler to be processed. The most typical example is that thanks to small computer devices such as laptops, smartphones, which are connected to the Internet, users can connect and communicate with each other easily anywhere without being obstructed by geographical distance. It can be seen that small computer technology is developing rapidly day by day. And in the near future, it is likely that there will be many potential inventions from these devices that make us admire such as smart devices, hologram electronic devices (keyboards, screens, phones, ... )</p>

                    <img src="./image/small-2.png" alt="">
                    <p>Not only that, besides the devices that are so familiar to us, another aspect in the area of small computing devices is also very interesting and useful, which is the single-board microcontroller as well as the single-board computers. These single-boards can simply be understood as low-cost, credit-card sized computers. Popular and particular names when it comes to microchips include Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and an extremely interesting invention in the 21st century - Makey Makey. Arduino is a single-board microcontroller used for building electronics projects. Instead of needing a separate piece of hardware similar to the previous circuit boards, users can simply code and program for Arduino by connecting with an IDE on the computer by USB cable. Moreover, it is easier for beginners to learn to program because it uses a simplified version of C++ to code. Besides, Arduino also can be received and transmit data through a variety of sensors and other motors and actuators. Arduino can interact with buttons, LEDs, motors, speakers, GPS units, cameras, the internet, and even your smart-phone or your TV. Arduino is often applied in interactive systems, especially automated systems. Projects on automated systems from Arduino are of great interest, especially to digital electronics experts. Products from Arduino can include home automation systems, robots, light control systems, health monitoring devices, etc. The Arduino can really be used as a brain in these projects. It can be seen that, with the current era of automation, automated products are gradually becoming popular, and Arduino is a choice that can be said to be the best in experimenting and even inventing the finished product at a reasonable cost.</p>

                    <img src="./image/small-4.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Different from Arduino, the Raspberry Pi is considered a single-board computer, which means a full computer can be built on it. The Raspberry Pi is a simple version of the same hardware in the laptop and the Raspberry Pi runs a Linux operating system. Raspberry allows programming in languages like Scratch and Python. Moreover, not only has the ability to interact with the surroundings, but Raspberry can also perform functions identical to a desktop computer such as word processing, Internet access. Raspberry was invented with the purpose of helping everyone, especially children, easily access programming, thereby improving their thinking and development skills. Applications like Tablet computers, Home automation, Internet radio, remote controlled robots, Cosmic computers, etc., are also based on Raspberry Pi. Raspberry can be seen as the future of computing devices. With its portability and relatively low cost compared to other devices, Raspberry offers a lot of things beyond our expectations. Raspberry is capable of handling anything comparable to a laptop. It is really a potential device in the technology industry in particular and has the ability to change the way the world operates in general.</p>

                    <p>And an extremely interesting and experimental invention in the field of small computing devices is Makey Makey. Makey Makey makes it possible for people to interact with their computer using anything around them instead of using a mouse and keyboard. They can control with clay, fruit, etc, and anything connected to the circuit board thanks to clips and alligator wire. In my opinion, this is an invention that deserves attention and development investment, it helps people have a different view of the programming world.  Programming is not simply dry lines of code, but we can apply them anywhere, any object around us. Makey Makey projects are fun like ladder piano keys, you can even connect and use a banana instead of the spacebar on the keyboard or simply draw arrows on the following paper, then connect them to the programmed board, which will replace the moving buttons. Makey Makey makes programming closer to life than ever, everyone can program. And especially, Makey Makey can also be connected to Arduino, from there, we can develop potential and useful projects.</p>

                    <p>Small computing devices have contributed a lot to the development and made people's lives more modern and easier. If in the past, technology devices often had a very bulky design to accommodate other components inside, making people's access to technology limited, but today, the advent of small computing devices significantly solved these problems. In the future, these computing devices are still likely to be developed and even more compact in size and improved in performance, as well as inventions of automated products will be made. These projects will probably replace the current unoptimized devices, and most likely in the near future, automated devices will replace traditional devices, the way the world works gradually change and develop over time.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, small computing devices have changed my life so much. In the past, when devices such as laptops, smartphones, even the Internet and WI-FI were not popular, accessing new information and knowledge was really difficult for me. In addition to reading books and absorbing the knowledge at school, to find more new information, I have to go to places with computers connected to the Internet to access and search for information. In addition, it is not easy to keep in touch with friends and relatives who are far away. Now, thanks to the great development of information technology in general and small computing devices in particular, the above problems are no longer difficult for me. I easily access the Internet and find information on my laptop, and even on my smartphone. It's also become easier to connect with people. Also, when I started to learn about single-board microcomputers, I gained a lot of knowledge about programming and I also found it very useful. I made a simple automatic plant watering system out of these circuit boards to make taking care of my parents' plants easier. To me, the development of small computing devices can be seen as a revolution in the world of IT and it will help the world develop a lot.</p>

                    <h3>What is AI?</h3>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence – Artificial intelligence is simply understood as intelligence demonstrated by machines. the opposite of it is the intelligence shown by living things, animals including humans. Machine learning (ML) in a particular definition ML is a branch of AI, it is a field of study that allows computers to have the ability to improve themselves based on training data or training data. based on experience (what has been learned). Machine learning can predict or make decisions on its own without being specifically programmed. There is no exact definition of intelligence, but a machine is considered to have intelligence when it exhibits at least one characteristic in the following table, the more characteristics shown, the more intelligent the machine.</p>

                    <h3>The transformation of AI</h3>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is created to solve problems that require human intelligence such as virtual assistants, voice recognition, image recognition, decision making or language translation ...  To find a way to help machines solve complex problems in life, we need to go from the simple problems first. The most representative issues, again, come from gaming, where there are fixed rules and clear goals. And to learn about artificial intelligence, let's learn about the history of how computers (algorithms) solve real-life games. <br>
                      Start with a 3x3 checkerboard game. At this point, the calculator simply stores all the possible moves, compares them with wins to make a move. Knowing 100% of the possible cases, making the optimal move is not difficult for computers. similarly, AI at this time can only interact with users through pre-loaded data. <br>
                      If 3x3 checkerboard is a simple game, chess is not like that, it is almost impossible to list all the possible moves. Therefore, the AI algorithm in the computer has also been upgraded, not only using a larger data base with more than 750,000 positions already loaded, and the ability to calculate the probability of each move and predict in advance from 2- 10 steps. IBM's Deep Blue in 1997 was created and has now won the highest Elo chess challenger, Kasparov. This algorithm is not only designed to play chess, but it also lays the groundwork for practical applications important computer science was at the heart of the competition, which advanced computers' ability to handle the kinds of complex calculations required to help discover new medical drugs, conduct broad financial modeling to identify trends and conduct risk analysis, search large databases, and perform massive calculations in a variety of fields. Although it was successful in winning, Deep Blue's algorithm also introduced many limitations: required technological power, algorithmic accuracy, and effort to initialize that algorithm, so the It's still not possible to apply it to everyday life.
                      <br>
                      After 20 years, in March 2016, AI proved its potential again when it achieved a new breakthrough when winning against Korean Go player Lee Sedol, who has the 2nd highest Elo score in the world. at that time. In the game of Go, the artificial intelligence Alpha Go is a combination of a convolutional neural network, a Monta Carlo search tree equal to the public value network with the results of the simulation games. This marks the ability to only follow what is programmed, but the computer can also create and learn to supplement its own data warehouse. To demonstrate the madness of artificial intelligence's self-learning ability, Elon musk created the OpenAI team, which studies artificial intelligence in even more challenging games – Dota, a game The game has billions of actions and moves at a time. After 1 month of training, artificial intelligence has made the most talented gamers in the world can only say: "it is a smarter version of me".

                    <h3>AI – Potentials and Challenges</h3>
                    <p>AI's potential is huge when in many industries, AI has proven its usefulness. can be mentioned as in traffic. Autonomous vehicle technology is being developed and shows that they can become mainstream in the future. When vehicles are all connected to the network and controlled by AI, coordination will become extremely efficient, reducing traffic jams, fuel consumption or even traffic accidents. Moreover, the current artificial intelligence has been able to do what was previously thought to be unique to humans, which is to create art, although it cannot create independently, it still needs the help of humans. but some artificial intelligences are now able to write songs themselves, paint completely new pictures. AI shows that this is an extremely powerful and useful technology when placed in each field, I believe it is even more powerful when applied to IOT - internet of things. with each AI-powered device, they can connect to each other to become a smooth, efficient, and optimized network of devices. <br>
                      Despite such promise, there are many challenges to achieving such potential. The first can be mentioned is limited hardware power. In the context of the covid-19 pandemic, the supply of semiconductor chips - the main component in microprocessors is extremely scarce. Smarter AI software requires more hardware power, and this requires an equally large amount of funding. This limits the application of popular artificial intelligence in life. Besides financial limitations, algorithmic problems are also considered as another obstacle when they are not really optimized and are still heavily dependent on human support. However, those are things that can be solved in the near future when technology is developing, and advanced algorithms are being developed day by day. The moral impediment is still controversial. Assuming an autonomous vehicle causes an accident, who is to blame, the developer, the driver, or the vehicle manufacturer? and finally, is AI trustworthy? If AI is integrated in the IoT system, all of our devices are connected to AI's information network, which means that the personal information of users will be easily collected by various sources of equipment.
                      </p>

                    <h3>Impact</h3> 
                     <p>In some fields, with the advantage of fast calculation ability, AI can make accurate and quick decisions to help get the job done quickly and avoid "human mistakes". Besides, dangerous jobs can also be assigned to AI robots. Artificial intelligence's most significant benefits by constructing an AI Robot that can do the dangerous tasks for us, we can transcend many of humanity's risky limits. It can be utilized efficiently in every type of natural or man-made disaster, whether it is travelling to Mars, defusing a bomb, exploring the deepest regions of the oceans, mining for coal and oil. <br>
                      With its applications automating the majority of the job, AI is making people lazy. Humans are prone to get hooked to these advancements, posing a threat to future generations. Furthermore, when AI replaces robots for the bulk of repetitive activities and other duties, human intervention is reduced, posing a serious concern in employment standards. Every company is attempting to replace minimum-qualified employees with AI robots that can perform comparable tasks more efficiently. Even more alarming, artificial intelligence accelerates the pace at which things may be achieved, and in many circumstances, it outpaces our capacity to keep up. With automation, criminal behaviors like phishing, virus transmission to software, and taking advantage of AI systems because of the way they interpret the world may be difficult for people to detect until a genuine problem arises.

                    <h1>Block Chain & Cryptocurrency</h1>
                    <p>As technology progressing, many problems are solved by newly advance and powerful tools, making people life convenient and can be actively monitor by electronic devices.  However, everything comes with a price, more convenience from a digitalized life resulted in the rise of cybercrime and the risk of information theft. Therefore, people have come up with many security solutions. Most popular among these is the invention of Block Chain and the birth of crypto currency.</p>

                    <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
                    <p>Block Chain is one of the most significant invention when it comes to the level of security. Because of the unique design and the clarity of a decentralized system, Block Chain has been applied in various field. However, most recognizable and significant among which is the crypto currency industry. Crypto currency or digitalized currency is a virtual coinage system that function very much like the standard currency, enable the users to make payment virtually without any service provide by a trusted third party thus no service fees is required when making payment. The concept of digitalized currency date back since 1980s and “rely heavily on the transmission of digital information, utilizing cryptographic methods to ensure legitimate, unique transactions” [1, P4]. Until 2009, when Bitcoin was launched, it took the whole concept to a new level, by decentralizing the system from a hierarchy system, individuals and businesses transact the coin electronically on a peer-to-peer network.</p>
                    <img src="./image/blockchain-1.png" alt="">

                    <h3>Bitcoin – the first cryptocurrency</h3>
                    <p>Initially, Bitcoin was proposed in 2008 in a white paper, published under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto stating that “Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weakness of the trust-based model” [2]. According to Nakamoto, the existence of a trusted third party would increase the transaction costs and reduce the possibility of small to casual transaction. Therefore, Nakamoto sought to create a currency where there are no trusted third parties and replace trust with cryptographic proof. This system would have the added benefits of having low transaction fees, low latency (time to make transactions), and pseudo-anonymity [1].</p>
                    <img src="./image/blockchain-2.png" alt="">

                    <h3>How cryptocurrency work?</h3>
                    <p>How a Bitcoin or merely any subsequent crypto currency work is fairly simple, each coin is a “chain of digital signatures” where “each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin” so that ownership can dynamically be programmed into the coin [2]. What’s more is that these lines of code are stored in a program called “wallet” which can be located on personal hard drives or online like Coinbase, Binance, etc. “Transactions are recorded by combining the digital signatures of each party and a timestamp, so that the transaction date is recorded. This new code represents the coin and its path through the network. This code is then broadcasted to all nodes (computers connected to and running the cryptocurrency network software) on the network. However, it is necessary that the majority of the nodes agree on transactions that have occurred, otherwise double-spending and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can occur.” [1]. Like cash or any other properties, Bitcoin can be lost, stolen or destroyed. One British man is famous for throwing away a hard drive storing 7000 BTC. That would be around 392 million USD in today price. Another example is Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange was hacked and lost nearly 350 million USD worth of Bitcoin in February 2014 and had to declared bankruptcy. This event raised a security concern among crypto currency investors.</p>
                    <img src="./image/blockchain-3.jpg" alt="">

                    <h3>Proof-of-Work (PoW) vs Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</h3>
                    <p>There are 2 concepts that must be explained when it comes to crypto currencies that are Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). PoW was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Noar in 1993. PoW, as the creator explained: “is a piece of data which is costly to produce so as to satisfy certain requirements but is trivial to verify.” [1]. PoW adds an economic cost for performing a function. A transaction cannot be verified if certain amount of energy has not been expended yet. Alternative to PoW, rather than using the computational power of the computer as legitimate work to verify the transactions, a PoS network security depends on the ownership of the coin itself. Elaborately, in order to verify the transactions within a PoS system, the users must own some coin themselves. There are also systems that use both PoW and PoS to verify the transactions. However, this means more resources are used and under some circumstances, not financially ideal.</p>
                    <img src="./image/blockchain-4.png" alt="">

                    <h3>Cryptocurrency impact on today life.</h3>
                    <p>Compare to traditional a traditional centralized database system such as the bank or stock market, cryptocurrency market provides the user with a clarified environment where every transaction is approved and verify by everyone in the system with fast respond time. Also, digitalized coin can be stored digitally on personal computer making the owners feel safer when they can monitor and protect their money by themselves. With mechanism such as PoW and Pos, the users can feel safe when making transactions as these mechanisms required scarce resources thus enhancing the security level and maintain the clarity of the transactions. Moreover, with investing being a modern trend, people starting to invest more in cryptocurrency, raising the price of them to the moon result in the wealth of many miners/investors who follow the industry long enough, some even became millionaire due to the price of Bitcoin rocketed up to 60 thousand USD in 2020, according to Coinbase. However, like any digital field, investing in cryptocurrency comes with the risk of scamming and hacking as well as the loss of files. Additionally, like any other investment, investors have to face the risk of the coin price fail to rise, they may suffer from capital tie or even capital losses. Therefore, it is important that each investor have their own vision as well as investing strategy.</p>
                    <img src="./image/blockchain-5.png" alt="">

                    <h3>The potential</h3>
                    <p>Today, Blockchain technologies is applied everywhere in our life. From medical records to bank statements, everything that required strict attention to security level can use the Blockchain technology. However, the only downside of Blockchain is that due to the nature of it, each block can only contain a small amount of data. Thus, the user would have to be very precise on which data they wish to store. Cryptocurrency on the other hand has been a controversial in the past few years. It is a dynamic market with high risks high profits. Many has become millionaire thanks to cryptocurrency. However, a significant of investor had declared bankruptcy because of it. Nowadays, many companies had come up with new idea on the application of cryptocurrency. Many decided to create a totally virtual world with a fully functional financial system using cryptocurrency. Facebook-now changed their name to Meta is the pioneer in this field. Other companies decided to create a new category of games that is “play-to-earn”. Basically, the players just have to get involve in the game so that they can earn the in-game currency. These currencies can be coins that was developed by that company and can be exchanged to real money later. Well-known names in this field are Axie Infinity, Decentraland, Mir4, etc.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Overall, cryptocurrency brings a new wave of financial exchange to the world. It is no doubt that it is attractive to investors. However, investing in cryptocurrency also comes with the risk of cybercrime, investors can be hacked and got all their money stole with just one mistake. Therefore, it is best that beginners do detailed researches before getting involved in the industry. Ultimately, with many applications and the benefits as well as the level of security mentioned above, cryptocurrency is stating their position in the economy world.</p>

            <p>For some people, time is as value as gold. There is always too much work to do but too little time to spare. Understand this difficulty, our team aim to design a virtual assistant which can help the users with doing tasks as well as enhancing workflow. Despite the concept of virtual assistant is not new, in fact, it appeared as soon as the 1980s. However, what distinguish our product to others available today such as Cortana or Siri is that we aim to create a self-learning assistant, who can gather information, analyze them and alter the algorithms accordingly. What’s more is that most of the virtual assistant today do not support Vietnamese language, which make it hard for Vietnamese people who do not know English have hard time using them. Similar to others assistant, to maximize the convenience for the users, our assistant will be able to communicate with users by voice input and can answer them within the accessible data. <br>
              Our assistant will have the ability to access different data sources when connected to internet. Instead of the users memorizing the information, our algorithms make sure that the information is organized and linked in such an optimal way that would remind the users of the information rather than making them remember them. The assistant will execute the commands with the accuracy up to 90% to ensure work efficiency. The product can also do basic tasks such as planning appointment, identify the question, access database or the internet to provide an accurate answer, etc. There will also be an advanced feature which the assistant would have access to the device system to gather information about screen time on different applications to come up with unique experience for different users. <br>
              At the moment, the project is currently being developed on WindowOS with Python programing language. However, our standard is high and aim for a cross-platform system. Our next phase will be developing an environment for the assistant on MacOS and move to mobile platform later. The assistant will have the ability to jump from device to device when needed. In the future, when smart household applications are more popular and use operating system like Window or Android can also use our product.

              <ul>
                <li>Application: pycharm, Pyinstaller </li>
                <li>Source/libraries: google voice, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-Learn, pyttsx3, overflow </li>
                <li>Dialogue</li>
                <li>Tool: computer, microphone, speaker </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Currently, our project can communicate with users, access to Wikipedia to find information, Access to Spotify to browse music. Still, the users need to insert a code, provided by Spotify that links to their account to use this feature. However, due to the project being under developing, users would need to know basic Python and English to use the assistant. It is not a difficult to create a virtual assistant. However, what make this project challenge is the implementation of machine learning to it. In order to make the algorithms understand the users’ behavior and habits, our team need to do research on the concepts of accurately scaling the assistant's response to create a machine learning tree that suitable for different users. Additionally, the accuracy of the product depends on the amount of data fed to it. Which means that the more the users use the assistant, the more efficient and synchronized it become result in a virtual assistant that actually understand and grow according to the users’ needs.</p>
